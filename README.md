Be specific and clear in your questions and statements. The more information you provide, the better the AI will be able to understand and respond to you.

Use proper grammar and punctuation. This will help the AI understand your message more easily.

Keep an open mind and be willing to try out different conversation topics. The AI is programmed to be able to have a wide range of discussions, so don't be afraid to explore different topics.

We hope you have a great time chatting with the AI! If you have any issues or questions while using the app, don't hesitate to reach out for support.
